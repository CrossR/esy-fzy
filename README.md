This project takes [fzy](https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy), and wraps it for building via `esy`.

The terminal based UI has been stripped in this case, to use this as a library.
Bindings for OCaml/Reason can be found at https://github.com/CrossR/reason-fzy.

Fzy itself is MIT licensed, and the license itself can be found [here](https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy/blob/master/LICENSE).
